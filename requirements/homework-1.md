Homework 1 - CNIT 133 Homework Page
Due Date: Aug 20
1. Create a web page, using HTML5, with the heading CNIT 133 Homework. The contents of this page can be a list containing the homework assignment numbers and their corresponding topics, most of them AS LINKS to web pages that will be developed throughout this course. You should list all homework assignments (Hw1 through Hw8). Hw1 should NOT be a link, whereas Hw2 through Hw8 should be links. The corresponding homework topics can be found on the course schedule page. Embellish this page with a background or bgcolor. Here is a Sample HW1 Web Page.

2. Alternatively, you can use a table for listing your homework assignments (enter columns for date due and date completed). Fill in the due dates for this semester, which can be found on each homework instruction page or on the calendar page. When you have finished a homework assignment and I have approved it, go back to this web page to fill in the date completed. Here is a Sample HW1 Web Page using a table and google fonts.. Here is a page that displays alternating colors on both rows and columns using CSS3. Here is a page that displays alternating colors on rows using jQuery. Here is a page that uses Bootstrap.

3. OPTIONAL: Enter a navigation bar at the top of the web page, which includes links to Hw2 through Hw8. Hw1 should be listed as text. To avoid redundancy, you may wish to enter the HW assignments in your list or table as text, NOT links.

4. Create the files hw2.html through hw8.html. You can use my Web Page template to build the shell for these files. Insert the corresponding title in the title tags. Enter some text or an image that shows the page as Under Construction. Save each file to your PC. Upload these files to your public_html directory and give them read permission. You will later create the content of these pages throughout the semester.

5. I suggest that you validate your Homework 1 page for HTML5 and CSS. You should include the Validation Icons at the bottom of your main HW1 page. Your Validation Icons should link to the validation result pages in order to to make it easier to re-validate this page in the future or to allow others to validate your page. 

If you need help in fixing very difficult to find validation errors, as noted from the validator, then you should email the TA for assistance.

6. OPTIONAL: On your homework page, include an example of JavaScript. For example: date last updated.

7. Do not just copy one of my sample pages and slightly modify it. You can use my sample pages as a guide but you need to design your own page. 

To submit your homework:

1. Once you upload your Homework 1 pages to the Hills server, make sure you can view the pages in a web browser.
2. Highlight the URL of your base Homework 1 page in the browser address bar and copy it.
3. Next, on this page, click the "Add Submission" button below.
4. Scroll down to the text box. Click in the text box and paste the URL. 
5. Click the "Save Changes" button to submit your assignment.

Resubmission:

If I don't approve your first submission, you'll see comments in the dialog box below. You won't receive a grade yet until you resubmit by clicking on "edit my submission" and in the box with your URL listed, tell me you've made the corrections and then resubmit. Then I'll look again, and if all is good, assign a grade.

After I have approved your Homework 1, you should post your "After Completion Report".
